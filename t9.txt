9.Using bash write a script to ﬁnd and remove duplicated fake IP addresses lines
  of "control_ﬁle.txt" ﬁle and save the output at /tmp/output_1.txt
  
Premisses:
- The script must receive an argument to process, which is the ﬁle name (control_ﬁle.txt);
- Find duplicated fake IP addresses and keep just the ﬁrst one. All other duplicated IP addresses must be removed;

E.g:

Using the lines below as example, the second one must be deleted:
540.300.759.124 lnx02csv lnx02csv.02csv.sps pid=1 ia1=y domain=02csv
myid=2 wsm=PR wid=1 wst=NA,HI,CP,SC,DS # ADM
540.300.759.124 lnx02csv lnx02csv.02csv.sps pid=1 ia1=y domain=02csv
myid=3 wsm=PR wid=1 wst=NA,HI,CP,SC,DS # ADM

The ﬁnal expected result is:

540.300.759.124 lnx02csv lnx02csv.02csv.sps pid=1 ia1=y domain=02csv
myid=2 wsm=PR wid=1 wst=NA,HI,CP,SC,DS # ADM

- All comment lines must be kept on the ﬁnal output ﬁle.
